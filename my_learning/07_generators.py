"""
 Generators are a special type of iterable that allow you to iterate over a sequence of values without storing
 the entire sequence in memory. They are defined using functions and the yield statement.

 Key Features of Generators
1. Lazy Evaluation: Generators produce values on-the-fly, which means they only generate values as needed.
This is useful for working with large datasets or streams of data.
2. Memory Efficiency: Since they donâ€™t store the entire sequence in memory, generators are more memory-efficient
than lists, especially for large datasets.
3. Easy to Implement: Generators are simpler to create than custom iterator classes, as they use
standard function syntax.

# Generator Expression: provide a shorthand way to create generators

for square in squares:
    print(square)  # Output: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25
